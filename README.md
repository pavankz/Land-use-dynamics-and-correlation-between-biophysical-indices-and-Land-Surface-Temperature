# Land use dynamics and correlation between biophysical indices and Land Surface Temperature in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), Telangana

## Abstract
Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC, Hyderabad) is experiencing unparalleled urbanization in recent times due to concentrated developmental activities with impetus on industrialization for the economic development of the region. These concentrated development activities have resulted in an increase in the population and consequently in infrastructure. This work identifies the relationship between six biophysical variables (NDVI, SAVI, Greenness, NDBI, NDBal, and DBI), and LST over a period of 35 years from 1988 to 2022, based om remote sensing and GIS. To facilitate the analysis a time-series of Landsat images TM, ETM+ and OLI/TIRS data and as well as various geospatial approaches were used. The result from the analysis shows that the urban built-up area has increased by 256.39 sqkm in contrast to the urban green space and barren land (others), which has been reduced by 43.49 sqkm and 77.47 sqkm. There is a possible rise in LST over time scale owing to the substitution of green cover by urban soil areas. The coefficient of correlation between the biophysical indices and LST shows a strong negative correlation exists between  vegetation biophysical indices (NDVI, SAVI and Greenness) and LST. In contrast to this , urban biophysical indices (NDBI, NDBal, DBI) were correlated positively in all years. This work provides a clear understanding of the urbanization and biophysical impacts on LST

## Objectives
1. Temporal LU change analysis (during 1988 to 2022)
2. Commputation of LST of Biophysical Indices from Lansat MSS, Landsat TM, Landsat                    ETM and Landsat OLI/TIRS of Summer Season  
3. Investigation of the role of Biophysical indices in LST
